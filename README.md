# Password-Manager---Firefox
Still working on improving this extension. 

This extension automatically scans a list of websites for its login button and form, checking whether the website contains a client side encryption system before it sends its user/password information to its server. The version that this extension works on is Firefox 1.17, and the SDK is included. May not be compatible with an earlier or updated version of Firefox. 

Make sure you disable all other extensions and password managers before trying to run this program. 

Follow the instructions on this page to install the Firefox SDK before running my extension through your cmd.
